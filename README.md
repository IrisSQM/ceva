## 关于希娃 About

希娃（CEva）是一个专门用于职业评估（**C**areer **EVa**luation）的开源软件。  
CEva is an open-source app built specifically for **C**areer **EVa**luation. 

## 背景故事 Background
### 灵感来源
人生怎么会没有弯路？曾经，有4条路摆在毛毛面前，毛毛搭出希娃，给自己做了一次评估。最后选择了得分最低的那条路，事实证明那条路通向天坑。  
好在，毛毛幸运地爬出了坑。这一次，新机会的希娃得分超过了前面所有机会。“柳暗花明又一村”，但是最好不要有前面的“峰回路转”。  
希娃是一个基于打分的评估模型，希望可以给职业规划带来一个理性视角。  

### How did CEva come into existence?
The creator has encountered the difficult moment of making a career decision. She created a 20-question score system to evaluate different options. Yet, biased by other concerns, she chose the one with the lowest score, which unsurprisingly sent her to hell.  
Fortunately, she was able to overturn the bad decision and come back to a right track. This time, the score for the new opportunity surpasses all previous ones.   
From that point, the idea of creating CEva began to sprout: there should be some rational framework out there to help make rational decisions.

### 工作机制
- 希娃的问卷包括20个五分制问题。总分100分，最低分20。    
- 好坏职业没有绝对的分界线。希娃最适合用于比较多个职位。
- 如果一个职位低于60分，就说明它**不及格**。你要小心！
- 当你对自己的选择感到不确定时，试试希娃。

### How does CEva work?
- CEva uses a 20-question score system. All questions are on a 5-point scale. So the maximum score is 100, minimum 20.     
- There are no absolute cutoffs for a good/bad job. So CEva is best used as a comparison tool between options.
- If a position scores less than 60, which means it **fails** the test. You should be cautious.
- Use CEva when you are uncertain about your career choice.
